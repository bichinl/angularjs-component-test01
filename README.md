#AngularJS - Component Test 01

*Angular JS v1.5*

-

Angular 1.5 recently introduced components, a feature also available in Angular 2. Using components from and in Angular 1.x makes a lot of the sense as it will help your application bridge the gap between Angular 1.x and Angular 2, which is the main reason why the Angular team announced components availability in Angular 1.5.

###What’s a component?
A component is basically a directive that uses a simpler configuration and that is suitable for a component-based architecture, which is what Angular 2 is all about.  Think of a component as a widget: A piece of HTML code that you can reuse in several different places in your web application.
